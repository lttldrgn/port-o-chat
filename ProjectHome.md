Port-o-chat is a small and portable chat client and server for LANs or small internet groups.  The client and server will run on any platform that runs Java and requires virtually no setup.  The protocol and client/server is inspired and loosely based off of an IRC model.

Our goal is to have an easy to use and stable software so please open a ticket if you find anything broken.

## Features ##
  * Person to person chat
  * Group chat through channels
  * Easily run your own local server

## Why another chat client? ##
Because we could, and we were bored?  It started as an experiment to see if we could write a working chat client over the course of a week at nights after work.  We still use it and work on it when we have a chance.
