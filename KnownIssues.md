## Auto Scrolling ##
If the cursor is moved from the bottom of the chat pane contents via clicking the mouse, the view will not auto scroll.  Workaround is to scroll all the way down and click the white space at the bottom.

## Launching server from client limitations ##
To launch the server from the client via menu, your working directory must be the same as the PortOChat.jar file.  If you launch it from another directory via script, etc. without setting the working directory, you will get an error and the server will not launch.
