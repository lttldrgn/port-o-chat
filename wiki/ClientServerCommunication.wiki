#summary Describes protocol that client and server use to communicate

==Client/Server communication basics==
In general, the client and server communication is asynchronous.  This means that neither the client or server waits for a reply to any request that is made.

==Client connection to server==
Client opens a TCP connection to the server host and port
Once connection is established, the client sends the user name to the server.
If accepted then, a success message is sent to the client.
Upon success message, the client then sends user and channel list requests.
